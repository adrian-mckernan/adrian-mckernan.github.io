This website links to the repositories needed to recreate the hardware and software used in the the paper. 

The aim of this project is to create a test bed for understanding phased arrays. 

The main hardware used is the LTC6946-4 PLL chip. 

The main PCB is an array of 5 LTC6946 chips with a common 10Mhz reference input. Each PLL is controlled by a dedicated microcontroller whcih communicated with a custom desktop application.
