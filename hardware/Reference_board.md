![Reference distribution PCB](../images/clock_dist.png)

When multiple PLL boards are stacked the 10Mhz reference needs to be buffered before each board. The same Hex inverter (74HC04) chip as used on the main PLLs boards is used. 

A pdf of the schematic for the 10MHz reference distribution bboard can be found at  [Clock distribution schematic](https://github.com/adrian-mckernan/Hardware/blob/main/clock_dist_v4/sch/clock_dist.pdf)
