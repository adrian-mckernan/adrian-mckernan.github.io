![PLL block diagram](../images/Power_Board.png)

Each PLL board accepts two power inputs a 4V and 6V. the 4V bus has local regulation to 3.3V for each microcontroller and PLL section. The ^v bus is used to directly power the Hex inverter reference buffer before being locally regulated to 5V for the PLL.
